## Important Launch Settings

In Supabase, the app's Site URL should be:

https://degrasse-mastermind.github.io/LaxHornet/

Redirect URLs should include:

https://degrasse-mastermind.github.io/LaxHornet/
https://degrasse-mastermind.github.io/LaxHornet/?auth=verified

Run the latest `supabase-schema.sql` before inviting a lot of users so multi-player cloud sync, team rosters, and player claims are current.
