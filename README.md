# LaxHornet

LaxHornet is a mobile-first offline PWA for tracking youth lacrosse stats during games. It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Player settings, active games, and saved games are stored in `localStorage`, with optional cloud sync and Live Share for real-time viewing on another device.

## Features

- Home, Player Settings, Start New Game, Live Game Tracker, Game Review, Past Games, and Season Dashboard screens
- Preloaded team roster picker with active-player switching
- Big one-handed live stat buttons for game-day use
- Game format selector for Quarters or Halves, with OT support
- Faceoff Win and Faceoff Loss tracking with faceoff win percentage
- Grouped live stat buttons with high-frequency events first and specialty stats lower on the screen
- Undo last event, save game, end game, review, and delete game actions
- Game Impact Score calculated from each event
- Per-player season totals and averages from saved games
- Offline-ready `manifest.json` and service worker
- Optional user profiles with Viewer, Tracker, and approval-required Admin roles
- Optional shared team rosters with viewer and tracker access levels
- Optional Live Share with a share code/link for read-only real-time viewing

## Local Setup

No install step is required.

```bash
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

You can also use any static file server. Serving over `http://localhost` is recommended so the service worker can register during testing.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings**.
3. Go to **Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select your branch, usually `main`, and the root folder `/`.
6. Save. GitHub Pages will publish the static PWA.

The app uses relative paths (`./`) so it can run from a GitHub Pages project URL such as:

```text
https://your-username.github.io/LaxHornet/
```

## Launch Kit

The `launch-kit/` folder includes a QR code, printable parent handout, PDF handout, and message templates for sharing LaxHornet with teams and families.

## Supabase Multi-User Setup

The app is configured for:

```text
https://ulbmjcvnyznvmjgpstno.supabase.co
```

To create or update the database tables:

1. Open the Supabase project dashboard.
2. Go to **SQL Editor**.
3. Open `supabase-schema.sql` from this repo.
4. Paste the full SQL into Supabase and run it.
5. In Supabase, open **Authentication > Providers** and make sure Email is enabled.
6. Open LaxHornet and create a user profile from the Home screen.
7. Start a new game.
8. Use **Copy Share Link** from the Live Game Tracker when you want a read-only viewer link.

Games and events are private to the signed-in user by default. Team roster games are visible to signed-in parents who joined the same team. Viewer accounts can review roster players and stats. Admin/tracker accounts can add roster players and enter shared team stats. Copying a share link marks that game as shared so family can watch it read-only from another iPhone.

Admin accounts must be approved by the platform reviewer account before they can create teams. The reviewer email is currently `degrassed@gmail.com`.

## Shared Team Rosters

Use **Team Roster** when multiple parents need to track or view stats for the same rostered players.

1. Sign in with a User Profile.
2. Create a team to generate a viewer invite code and tracker access code.
3. Add rostered players by name and jersey number.
4. Give most parents the viewer code so they can see the roster and stats.
5. Give the tracker code only to parents who should add roster players or enter shared team stats.
6. The other parent signs in, joins the team, syncs teams, and selects the same rostered player.

Best practice: choose one official tracker for each player/game. Multiple parents can sync and review the same stats, but two tracker accounts logging the same player at the same time can create duplicate events.

## Stat Scoring

- Goal: +5
- Assist: +4
- Save: +3
- Shot on Goal: +2
- Shot: +1
- Ground Ball: +3
- Caused Turnover: +3
- Defensive Stop: +3
- Successful Clear: +2
- Backed Up Shot: +2
- Hustle Play: +1
- Smart Play: +1
- Turnover: -2
- Failed Clear: -2
- Goal Allowed: -2
- Penalty: -2
- Note: 0

For dashboard percentages, `Shot on Goal` counts as both a shot and a shot on goal. The `Shot` button is best used for shots that are not on goal.
