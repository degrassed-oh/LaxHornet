    focus: "Keep getting to good spots, then add one support play like a feed, ride, or ground ball to round out the impact.",
  },
  assist: {
    label: "Assist",
    meaning: "A pass or feed that directly creates a goal.",
    why: "Assists show vision and timing. They turn a teammate's cut or dodge into a better scoring chance.",
    focus: "Keep your head up after pressure and move the ball before the defense fully recovers.",
  },
  shot: {
    label: "Missed Shot",
    meaning: "A shot attempt that misses the cage.",
    why: "Missed shots still show offensive involvement, but they also help reveal when shot quality can improve.",
    focus: "Look for higher-quality shots by changing angle, getting closer, or moving the ball one more time.",
  },
  shotOnGoal: {
    label: "Shot on Goal",
    meaning: "A shot that forces the goalie to make a save or goes into the cage.",
    why: "Shots on goal force the defense and goalie to react. They can create rebounds, backups, and unsettled chances.",
    focus: "Aim for spots that make the goalie move, and be ready for the rebound or backed-up shot.",
  },
  goalieSave: {
    label: "Save",
    meaning: "A goalie stop that prevents a scoring chance from becoming a goal.",
    why: "A save protects the scoreboard, but it can also become the first play of the next possession.",
    focus: "Recover quickly, organize the clear, and find the safest outlet.",
  },
  goalAllowed: {
    label: "Goal Allowed",
    meaning: "An opponent shot that scores.",
    why: "Goals allowed give context for the pressure the goalie and defense faced, especially when shot quality varies.",
    focus: "Reset quickly, communicate the next coverage, and prepare for the next save or outlet.",
  },
  faceoffWin: {
    label: "Faceoff Win",
    meaning: "A won faceoff or draw that gives your team the ball.",
    why: "Faceoff wins create immediate possession. The next step is turning that win into controlled offense.",
    focus: "Win the clamp or loose ball, then make the first clean pass before pressure arrives.",
  },
  faceoffLoss: {
    label: "Faceoff Loss",
    meaning: "A faceoff or draw where the other team gains possession.",
    why: "Tracking losses helps show the possession battle and where wing support or ground-ball follow-up can help.",
    focus: "Compete through the loose ball, communicate with wings, and be ready to defend the next possession.",
  },
  groundBall: {
    label: "Ground Ball",
    meaning: "A loose-ball pickup that helps your team gain or keep possession.",
    why: "Ground balls create extra chances and often decide who controls the game before the scoreboard shows it.",
    focus: "Get low, move through the ball, and secure the first clean pass before looking upfield.",
  },
  turnover: {
    label: "Turnover",
    meaning: "A possession that changes to the other team.",
    why: "Turnovers show where pressure, spacing, or decision speed affected the possession.",
    focus: "Move the ball earlier, use the nearest outlet, and recover quickly into the next play.",
  },
  causedTurnover: {
    label: "Caused Turnover",
    meaning: "A defensive play that helps force the opponent to lose possession.",
    why: "Caused turnovers disrupt rhythm and can turn opponent pressure into a new possession.",
    focus: "Keep body position first, then use smart stick pressure to force rushed decisions.",
  },
  defensiveStop: {
    label: "Defensive Stop",
    meaning: "A play that prevents an opponent from turning possession into a quality chance.",
    why: "Defensive stops show positioning, communication, and team defense beyond the box score.",
    focus: "End the stop with a clean pickup, outlet, or recovery to the next threat.",
  },
  successfulClear: {
    label: "Successful Clear",
    meaning: "A clean move from defense into offense while keeping possession.",
    why: "Clears protect possession after pressure. A clean clear turns defense into offense.",
    focus: "Find the safest outlet first, then move the ball before the ride arrives.",
  },
  failedClear: {
    label: "Failed Clear",
    meaning: "A clear attempt where the other team gets the ball back.",
    why: "Failed clears show where pressure disrupted possession and where support or spacing can improve.",
    focus: "Use width, talk early, and give the ball carrier a simple outlet.",
  },
  hustlePlay: {
    label: "Hustle Play",
    meaning: "An effort play that helps the team even if it does not appear in a traditional stat line.",
    why: "Hustle plays show effort away from the scoreboard. They often create the extra chance that leads to a bigger moment later.",
    focus: "Keep sprinting through the play, then turn the effort into a controlled possession.",
  },
  backedUpShot: {
    label: "Backed Up Shot",
    meaning: "A hustle play to the endline or sideline that helps retain possession after a shot.",
    why: "Backing up shots protects offensive possessions and gives the team another chance to attack.",
    focus: "Anticipate the shot path early and beat the defender to the endline or sideline.",
  },
  smartPlay: {
    label: "Smart Play",
    meaning: "A decision that helps the team stay organized, safe, or connected.",
    why: "Smart plays show awareness, timing, and decision-making. They help a player grow even without a traditional stat.",
    focus: "Recognize the simple play early, communicate it, and keep the possession connected.",
  },
  penalty: {
    label: "Penalty",
    meaning: "A rule infraction that affects possession, field position, or personnel.",
    why: "Penalties show how discipline, footwork, and positioning affect team flow.",
    focus: "Keep feet moving, stay balanced, and compete with controlled contact.",
  },
  note: {
    label: "Note",
    meaning: "A quick observation for game review.",

        <h3>Game Impact</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Game Impact displays as a letter grade with the underlying 0-100 score shown beneath it. It estimates how much a player helped create possessions, convert possessions, protect possessions, and prevent opponent chances. It is built from five pillars: scoring, possession, defense, goalie play, and effort.</p>
        <p class="muted small">The score is position-weighted. Attack gives more credit to scoring, midfield values possession and effort, defense/LSM values defense and effort, faceoff/draw heavily values possession, and goalie heavily values saves and goalie-specific plays.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Average Impact</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Average Impact appears on the Season page. It is the player's saved Game Impact scores averaged across games played. Example: game scores of 78, 84, and 69 create a 77.0 Average Impact.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Points vs Impact</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Lacrosse points are goals plus assists. Game Impact is broader: it also counts ground balls, clears, defensive stops, faceoffs, goalie saves, backed up shots, hustle plays, smart plays, and mistakes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Possession Impact</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Possession Impact separates volume from value. Extra Possessions counts how many additional chances the player helped create or protect. Possession Value weights how important those possession-changing plays were.</p>
        <p class="muted small">Examples: a ground ball adds +1 extra possession and +1.2 Possession Value. A caused turnover adds +1 and +1.8. A save retained by the team adds +1 and +2.5. Turnovers and failed clears subtract from both.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Backed Up Shot</h3>
        <p class="muted small">A Backed Up Shot is when the player hustles to the endline or sideline to retain possession after a shot. It adds +2 to the effort pillar behind Game Impact.</p>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Effort Score</h3>

Live Share is a small link beside the game date so family can watch from another iPhone, phone, tablet, or computer. The link automatically copies to the clipboard, so just paste it into a text or email.</p>

        <p class="muted small">After a game, open Game Review to edit events, correct notes, add tags, and check Game Impact, Effort Score, Faceoff %, Save %, and shooting percentages. Season Dashboard shows Average Impact across saved games. Past Games follows the active player, so switch players when you want another player's totals.</p>
