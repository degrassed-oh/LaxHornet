It is built from five pillars: scoring, possession, defense, goalie play, and effort.</p>

        <h3>Possession Impact</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Possession Impact separates volume from value. Extra Possessions counts how many additional chances the player helped create or protect. Possession Value weights how important those possession-changing plays were.</p>
        <p class="muted small">Examples: a ground ball adds +1 extra possession and +1.2 Possession Value. A caused turnover adds +1 and +1.8. A save retained by the team adds +1 and +2.5. Turnovers and failed clears subtract from both.</p>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Backed Up Shot</h3>
        <p class="muted small">A Backed Up Shot is when the player hustles to the endline or sideline to retain possession after a shot. It adds +2 to the effort pillar behind Game Impact.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>Effort Score</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Effort Score is Hustle Plays plus Ground Balls plus Backed Up Shots. It is a simple count of extra-possession effort plays.</p>

      <p>A fast guide to tracking a game, saving data, and sharing live stats.</p>

    <section class="stack tutorial-list">
      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>1. Set Up The Player</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Open Player to review the selected player. Use Team to sync team data, request access, and verify roster access by jersey number.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>2. Sign In To Save Your Stats</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Use a User Profile when you want games saved to your account. Each approved player/team context stays separate, while team roster stats can stay connected across approved parent accounts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>3. Create Or Join A Team</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Use a team access code from the team admin to request access. After approval, verify your player by jersey number.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>4. Pick One Parent Tracker</h3>
        <p class="muted small">For the cleanest stats, pick one official Parent Tracker for each player/game. Other family members can watch using Live Share from another iPhone, phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>5. Track A Game</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Tap Track New Game, double-check the player selector, enter the opponent, and choose Quarters or Halves. In Live Game, use the subtle period buttons so each event lands in the right part of the game.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>6. Track Fast</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Live stats are grouped by game flow: Offense, Possession / IQ, Defense / Clears, and Specialty. The most common field events stay higher on the page, while faceoff, goalie, and note buttons sit lower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>7. Save, Undo, And Share</h3>
        <p class="muted small">Undo removes the last event. Save keeps the game locally and syncs it when you are signed in. Live Share is a small link beside the game date so family can watch from another iPhone, phone, tablet, or computer. The link automatically copies to the clipboard, so just paste it into a text or email.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>8. Review, Correct, And Tag</h3>
        <p class="muted small">After a game, open Game Review to edit events, correct notes, add tags, and check Game Impact, Effort Score, Faceoff %, Save %, and shooting percentages. Season Dashboard shows Average Impact across saved games. Past Games follows the active player, so switch players when you want another player's totals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card pad">
        <h3>9. Watch A Shared Game</h3>
        <p class="muted small">On Home, expand Watch Shared Game, enter the share code or open a shared link, and follow the read-only live timeline from another device.</p>
